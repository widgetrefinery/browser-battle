# browser-battle

This is just a quick and dirty project to explore html5 and javascript. It recreates a rough approximation of a final fantasy battle.

I mainly tested with chrome but it *should* work with any modern browser.

I take no credit for the art. The art came from [spriters resource](http://www.spriters-resource.com/snes/ff6/).
